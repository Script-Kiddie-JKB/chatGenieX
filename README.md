### Troubleshooting

- Auto reply does not work even after ChatGenieX is enabled

  ChatGenieX relies on WhatsApp notifications for auto reply to work. Most users usually have notifications enabled so should work straight out of the box but otherwise please make sure WhatsApp notifications are enabled and WhatsApp fingerprint lock is disabled for this app to work.

### FAQ

  You cannot use business account without accepting the new privacy policy that everyone is trying to avoid.
